# Creating basic plots for some data

This repo hosts some scripts I wrote to create basic exploratory plots on [this dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption#). You can get the dataset directly from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00235/) by clicking on 'household_power_consumption'. 

Make sure you download the dataset if you intend to run the scripts. I did not push it to the repo.

The scripts read the zip files directly to create the plots. You will not need to unzip the file.
